## Link

[Root directory access home page] (/)

[Relative path access homepage](../README.md)

[Root directory access example](/demo)

[Example of relative path access](../../demo/README.md)

```md
[Root directory access home page] (/)

[Relative path access homepage](../README.md)

[Root directory access example](/demo)

[Example of relative path access](../demo/README.md)
```

::: tip

VuePress is also compatible with the following way of jumping to the home page:

- [Relative path access, compatible with Markdown to jump to each other when writing](../README.md)

- [Root directory access homepage 2](/README.md)

- [HTML format](../index.html)

If you want to be able to jump to each other when editing Markdown with an editor, you need to use all **relative paths**, and `README.md`**cannot be omitted**.

code:

```md
[Root directory access homepage 2](/README.md)

[Relative path access, compatible with Markdown to jump to each other when writing](../README.md)

[HTML format](../index.html)
```
