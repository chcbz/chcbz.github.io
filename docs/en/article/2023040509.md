Recently, I am using vuepress to make my own blog. I opened vscode, which has been dusty for a long time, but found a problem. Every time I switch to other applications and then switch back to vscode, it will freeze for a few seconds, which greatly reduces the user experience.
I opened the task manager and looked at it, and found that the CPU usage reached 100%. At first I thought that the CPU of the laptop was too low, and I planned to see if my ThinkPad T480 could upgrade the CPU, but the Internet said that the CPU of the T480 is a blade design, and most people cannot replace it.
Then I googled the reason why vscode is slow. The first search result said that there were too many plug-ins installed, which caused the slowness, but this is not easy to troubleshoot.
Then look at the second search result, [vscode running stuck solution](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43599212/article/details/129175936), really solved the problem, the specific operation is as follows:

> File->Preferences->Settings->Search "search.followSymlinks" and uncheck it.
