Since my friend rewrote the code, it took him more than an hour to get started quickly and build a simple springboot application. Finally, he finished writing a simple springboot-demo and started it directly on eclipse. Now share it with A friend in need. See the source code address at the end of the article, the operation steps are as follows:

1. Copy the settings.xml file in the maven directory to the .m2 directory in the user directory (eg: C:\Users\Think\.m2\settings.xml)

2. Click the menu File->Import->Existing Maven Projects in eclipse, and select the code directory.

3. Execute the table creation statement in the sql directory in the database.

4. Open the project in eclipse and modify the database connection information in application.properties.

5. Right-click the SpringbootDemoApplication.java file and select Run As -> Spring Boot App.

6. After successful startup, visit `http://localhost:8080/get-by-email?email=c@c.com` on the browser
