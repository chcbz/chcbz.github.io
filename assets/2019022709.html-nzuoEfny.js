BiPAC 6402R3 supports three types of VPN: IPSec, PPTP and L2TP.</p></li><li><p>IPSec VPN refers to a VPN technology that uses the IPSec protocol to achieve remote access. IPSec is a security standard framework defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to provide end-to-end encryption and authentication services for public and private networks . The IPsec protocol is not a separate protocol. It provides a complete set of architecture for network data security on the IP layer, including network authentication protocols AH, ESP, IKE, and some algorithms for network authentication and encryption.</p></li><li><p>PPTP refers to encapsulating PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) frames into IP packets and sending them through IP networks, such as the Internet or other enterprise-specific intranets. The PPTP protocol assumes that there is a connected and available IP network between the two peers of PPTP, that is to say, PPTP VPN is a functional network based on the established basic network. If the PPTP client itself is already part of an IP network, it can be connected to the PPTP server through the IP network.</p></li><li><p>L2TP (Layer Two Tunneling Protocol, Layer Two Channel Protocol) is a kind of VPDN (Virtual Private Dial-up Network) technology, which is specially used for the channel transmission of the second layer data, that is, the second layer data frame, such as point-to-point Protocol (PPP) data frames are encapsulated in IP or UDP payloads to smoothly pass through packet-switched networks (such as the Internet) and reach their destinations, thereby logically connecting two separated physical networks directly.</p></li></ul>',8),c=[l];function p(u,h){return t(),o("div",null,c)}const g=e(s,[["render",p],["__file","2019022709.html.vue"]]);export{g as default};
