Baidu Encyclopedia says this: architecture, also known as software architecture, is an abstract description of the overall structure and components of software, and is used to guide the design of all aspects of large-scale software systems. Then we can also see that the architecture is closely related to the business and driven by the business.</p><p>Due to the characteristics of the App client, the technical implementation of the App background is different from the general Web background. First look at a development model suitable for App development:</p><h2 id="agile-development-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#agile-development-model" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Agile development model</h2><p>Scrum, an agile development framework, is recommended here.

For example, tasks such as sending emails, text messages, and push messages are very suitable for processing in the message queue.</p><p>Putting these tasks in the message queue can speed up the response time of App background requests.

A large number of applications and services are aggregated in the system, and many functions are repeatedly implemented among various modules (such as the login module). Difficulty in maintenance and deployment.</p><figure><img src="'+u+'" alt="Distributed service architecture diagram" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Distributed service architecture diagram</figcaption></figure><p>Repeated modules in a large number of applications will bring a large number of accesses, and the connection between each application and the database generally uses the connection pool of the database. The resources of this connection pool are generally not released and are always reserved. Assuming that there are 10 connections in the connection pool, in a server cluster of hundreds, 1000 connections are occupied in the database. Each connection in the database is a very precious resource. In the case of limited resources, if it is occupied here, other available resources will be less.</p><p>The solution to these problems is to independently deploy the repeatedly implemented modules as remote services, and the newly added business calls the functions provided by the remote service to realize related businesses, independent of the specific code implementation inside.</p><figure><img src="'+p+'" alt="Distributed service architecture diagram 2" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Distributed service architecture diagram 2</figcaption></figure><p>To implement remote services, you can refer to the REST design principles and the RPC remote call protocol.</p><p>Open source RPC libraries include:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Open source RPC library</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hprose</td><td>Lightweight, cross-language, cross-platform, non-intrusive, high-performance dynamic remote object call engine library</td></tr><tr><td>Dubbo</td><td>Distributed service framework, dedicated to providing high-performance and transparent RPC remote call services and SOA service governance solutions</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="best-practices-for-user-authentication-schemes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#best-practices-for-user-authentication-schemes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Best practices for user authentication schemes</h2><p>App operations often involve user login operations, and login requires the use of user names and passwords.

Use HTTPS protocol</h3><p>The HTTPS protocol is a combination of the HTTP protocol and the SSL/TLS protocol. It is a secure communication channel, developed based on HTTP, for exchanging information between the client computer and the App background.

Basic user authentication scheme</h3><p>Traditional Web sites use Cookie+Session to maintain the user&#39;s login status, while the App background uses tokens for verification. The process is as follows:</p><figure><img src="'+b+'" alt="User authentication scheme" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>User authentication scheme</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, the app has obtained the token value. For security reasons, we do not transmit the token on the network, but use signature verification (URL signature is used here). The API request plus the URL signature sign and user id is as follows:</p><p><code>test.com/user/update?uid=2&amp;sign=3f1e736bc4ae958ae7e8500b45aefdbb&amp;age=22</code></p><p>This way, the token doesn&#39;t need to be attached to the URL. The App background signature verification process is as follows:</p><figure><img src="'+f+'" alt="App background signature verification process" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>App background signature verification process</figcaption></figure><p>Some children&#39;s shoes like to set a timestamp, so that the URL will become invalid after a long time, which is also a good further optimization solution.</p><p>*Suggestion: In order to ensure data security, it is recommended to use HTTPS and signature verification at the same time. ***</p><h2 id="the-evolution-principle-of-app-background-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-evolution-principle-of-app-background-architecture" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The evolution principle of App background architecture</h2><p>The architecture of the App background is driven by the business scale and evolves. The App background serves the business. The value of the App background is that it can provide the functions required by the business and should not be over-designed.</p><p>From the perspective of the project, when the number of app visits is not large, the app background should be built quickly, so that the app can be launched as soon as possible to provide services to users, verify the correctness of the business model, and rapidly iterate products.</p><p>When the number of app visits continues to increase, it is necessary to take into account high performance and high availability while ensuring rapid iteration.</p><p>When the number of app visits reaches a certain stage, the growth curve will slow down, but the business becomes more complex, and the requirements for high performance and high availability are also higher. Performance problems, coupling between modules, and code complexity will become more prominent And obviously, at this time, issues such as business splitting, distributed service invocation, and even technological transformation must be used.</p><h3 id="_1-when-the-project-starts-stand-alone-deployment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-when-the-project-starts-stand-alone-deployment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.

When the data reaches a certain scale, the query and read performance will drop sharply. The database master-slave architecture cannot cope with the read and write pressure of the business. At this time In terms of architecture, table splitting (horizontal splitting/vertical splitting) should be considered.</p><p>When the business continues to develop, the read and write performance of the database table partition may not be able to meet the business needs. At this time, only a further split strategy - database partitioning can be adopted.
